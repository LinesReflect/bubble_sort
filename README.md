Going into this problem I knew that I would have to compare the numbers in an array to one another and possibly swap them and did not find much difficulty figuring out how to do that. The main problem for me was that I could not figure out how to go through the array more than one time. After looking at some psuedocode I added in the swap variable and set it to false at the beginning of each run through the array. If a swap was made then the swap variable was set to true. At the end of the run through an array, if swap is true then I just ran bubble_sort again.
